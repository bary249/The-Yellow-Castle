**Design Notes – Card Mechanics (Technical Translation)**

**Traps / Mines**

* Place a hidden card on a specific terrain tile (e.g., lake, Forest).
* The opponent cannot see the card.
* When an enemy unit enters that tile, the trap is triggered and the unit takes **damage**.

**Burning (Fire Effect)**

* Any unit currently occupying a **Forest** tile takes **damage**.
* Affected units are **pushed back by one tile** (knockback), **if the target tile is unoccupied / valid**.

**Spy**

* Can infiltrate the enemy base **without being revealed** to the opponent.
* Upon activation, the Spy **eliminates one enemy unit**.
* After the action resolves, the Spy **is destroyed (self-sacrifice)**.
