I want us to have an "X" - an x means the situation of the game in any given moment.
including which card are placed where and what are thier stats.
I want us to print the X in a readiable way after every turn.

Add ability to simulate 100 games from the backend and analyze them for balancing the game.

Add many cards to the game and make it fun to play by creating interesting card combination synergy and rivalry (check @GAME_TODO).

The top and bottom cards shuold be in respect to the side of the player. (so top cards are close to the middle line, and bottom card are closer the the player/oppeonent)
