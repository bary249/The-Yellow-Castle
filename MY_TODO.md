Bugs:
Drag and drop from withihn the board with 1 ap shows purple border but not working.
End of game rteturn to main menu
Retalition of ranged unit damage shuold be 35% of thier current damage.
Late dialogs (user suddenly sees the battle result dialog from the opponent perspective).
After seeing a terrain of the opponent base once, it should be revealed for the rest of the game,
If an oppoenet attacked you, the tile they are on should be revealed for 2 turns


Add hero ability dialog for player and oponnet, and make sure it shows on cards,it showes a dialog to the enemy in the pvp, and that it's only availabe 1 per turn




Remove "terrain" from common cards.
Add  special abilities to cards based on unit vs unit buff/debuff, use your logic and historical knowledge, for example pikeman are good vs horses, archer's are bad if melle attacks them so they should have -4 retaliation damage when defending from a melle attack and more and more and more, first confirm all with me then implement.
