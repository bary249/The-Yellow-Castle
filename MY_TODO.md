Can't see the new deck selection screen for pve and pvp

Make sure simulation mode works with the same current logics as the other modes.
and make sure that the game summary include both simulation plaeyrs final base HP.

Decoy: rip should mention decoy. 
The battle simulation and battle result dialog of a decoy should mention it's a decoy.
Make sure the decoy mechanism works! i just tested and my decoy retaliated and killed an enemy card.


Make battle log sidepane follow the turn by turn progression for watch replay mode.
