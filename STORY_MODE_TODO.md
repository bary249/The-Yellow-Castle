Changes to Story mode:

1. We want the encounter selection to be on a "real map" that is relevant to the campaign, so the battle location is actually placed on a "real map" (not just a random location on the map).
2. We want to add a "Map Relic" to the campaign mode, that is hidden on a random location on the map and can be found by the player in random encounters.
3. We want each campaign to have a real "Home Town", this home town can be improved with gold throughout the campaign run.
4. The Home Town buildings are buildings that provide gold/cards/items/relics.
5. We want cards to have persistent "destruction" throughout the campaign run - meaning cards that get destroyed in battle are gone.
6. The buildings in the home town that provide cards, have a "supply time" to them, that considers each encounter as an iteration.
7. Every campaign home town starts with basic common cars training grounds, that provide cards each encounter.
8. The advanced buildable buildings provide cards in higher rarity, but slower supply time.
9. The distance of the hero from the home town (base node) also affects supply time.
10. Hero Progression nodes should also have perks for the home town, that can be unlocked as the hero progresses.
11. A dialog should pop for the player each time a new card/gold/item/relic is provided to the player from their home town.
12. Winning enctouner nodes,s should provide gold, and a pre-determined offer of items/relics/buildings (the buildings should be mainly around reducing the supply time of home town buildings) based on the node type (city/battle grounds/defence).
13. The Player should be able to see the home town buildings, and the distance to them/the supply time of the buildings.
14. The Player should be able to see the pre-determined reward of an encounter before selecting the encounter.
15. Shop encounters should allow to "repair" cards that were destroyed in battle, for a price.
16. After every encounter the Player should be able to buy stuff in the home town.
17. The Encounter location should affect the middle and enemy base terrain, based on the true real location of the encounter on the real earth map.
18. Some encounter nodes are conqurable cities. Conquered cities allow the player to play a defence encounter(as one of the selectable encounters after the conquer encounter), this is an easier encounter where the player has a +1 damage +1 hp to all cards for these types of battles. (They are mainly to "wait" for supply arrival)
