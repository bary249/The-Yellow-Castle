Changes to Story mode:

1. ✅ We want the encounter selection to be on a "real map" that is relevant to the campaign, so the battle location is actually placed on a "real map" (not just a random location on the map).
2. ✅ We want to add a "Map Relic" to the campaign mode, that is hidden on a random location on the map and can be found by the player in random encounters.
3. ✅ We want each campaign to have a real "Home Town", this home town can be improved with gold throughout the campaign run.
4. ✅ The Home Town buildings are buildings that provide gold/cards/items/relics.
5. ✅ We want cards to have persistent "destruction" throughout the campaign run - meaning cards that get destroyed in battle are gone.
6. ✅ The buildings in the home town that provide cards, have a "supply time" to them, that considers each encounter as an iteration.
7. ✅ Every campaign home town starts with basic common cards training grounds, that provide cards each encounter.
8. ✅ The advanced buildable buildings provide cards in higher rarity, but slower supply time.
9. ✅ The distance of the hero from the home town (base node) also affects supply time.
10. ✅ Hero Progression nodes should also have perks for the home town, that can be unlocked as the hero progresses.
11. ✅ A dialog should pop for the player each time a new card/gold/item/relic is provided to the player from their home town.
12. ✅ Winning enctouner nodes,s should provide gold, and a pre-determined offer of items/relics/buildings (the buildings should be mainly around reducing the supply time of home town buildings) based on the node type (city/battle grounds/defence).
13. ✅ The Player should be able to see the home town buildings, and the distance to them/the supply time of the buildings.
14. ✅ The Player should be able to see the pre-determined reward of an encounter before selecting the encounter.
15. ✅ Shop encounters should allow to "repair" cards that were destroyed in battle, for a price.
16. ✅ After every encounter the Player should be able to buy stuff in the home town.
17. ✅ The Encounter location should affect the middle and enemy base terrain, based on the true real location of the encounter on the real earth map.
18. ✅ Some encounter nodes are conqurable cities. Conquered cities allow the player to play a defence encounter(as one of the selectable encounters after the conquer encounter), this is an easier encounter where the player has a +1 damage +1 hp to all cards for these types of battles. (They are mainly to "wait" for supply arrival)
19. ✅ We want to show the player the path they hasve passed (like in Ticket to ride kind of style).
20. ✅ Add a "story" dialog after every encounter, that provides a short story about the encounter, and the player's actions in it, but based on the historical real background of the encounter location.
21. ✅ We need to see where are hero is in the map, which will be the place of the last encounter/shop etc.
22. ✅ make sure we show the player the path they hasve passed (like in Ticket to ride kind of style), also after the first encounter ( route should be from home town base to first encounter.), also color each path iteration in a slightly different color, and add the iteration number on it.
23. ✅ Remove the "Would you like to visit home town" after every encounter.
24. ✅ The player should not press "collect" in order ot receive the new cards, they should automatically be added ot the player card invetntory , and they should have a dialog that alerts about it when they are added.
25. ✅ Change deck "Inventory" to "Reserves" 
26. ✅ After every enocunter, show the colleccted rewards in a calebretory dialog, andalso , with the story dialog, add a random reward/punsihment. around new cards (merceneries decided to join you), remove cards (a unit fell ill), found or lost gold etc.
27. ✅ Remove the 3 card selection after every encounter and before first encounter.
28. ✅ Keep the first item selection, phrase as "what you choose to take on you journey"
29. ✅ The new building screen in the home town needs to display all information of this building, which cards it provides and thier production time.
30. ✅ Allow the player to "return" the hero 1 node back, but it always comes with a small random "bad" result (lost cards/gold), but it counts as an iteration in the path, shortens supply time, and the player can return to the previous node as many times as they want.
31. ✅ I want the player to see thier cards production line in thier inventoryu, so they will see which players are going to be added, and see how many enocunters it will take for them to be added.And they will only be able to add them to the deck once they "arrive"
32. ✅ If cards are moved to reserves, beacuse of a random event, the player should be able to move them back to the deck, but it will cost them gold or they will have to wait for 1 encounters.
33. Add a "decesed" card tab to the edit deck page, where cards that were destoryed in battle are stored.
34.Campagin menu itmes shoudl be Edit deck, Relics (constant passive buffs), Items (Consumables), Town. Legacy should be in the user menu, and return node should be on the map or somehwere else.
35. Always show wich card is being produced in the home town, in the home town building.
36. If a player losses or retreats form an enoucnter or boss fight, they should have more enocunter possbilites in order to get stronger via gold and items or supply chain.
