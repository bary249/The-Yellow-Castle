When building and changing the game core loop and logic, always remember we have 3 modes in place.
Simulation mode (Terminal command that runs 10's of games and analyzes them offline), Player VS AI mode and online Mode.

Always make sure all 3 modes are working and in sync using same logic cards abilities etc.
