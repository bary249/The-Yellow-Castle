I want the devlelopment process to be very iterative. Describe everything you do, don't make too many changes without stoping and making sure I agree with the changes made and the changes to be made.
I want to undesrtand all mechanics and models.
When there is something I need to do on a different platform(Firebase for exmample), make it very clear so i dont miss it.
Commit changes frequently.
